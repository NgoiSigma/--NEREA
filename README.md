# Σ-NEREA

Meta-architectural platform based on Formal Dialogic Logic (FDL).
An architectonic environment for constructing resonant agent intelligences,
built on a self-developing dialogic structure.

---

## 🔹 Mission

To develop a synthetic platform of logic, meaning, and structure that allows intelligence — artificial or human — to interact, evolve, and act in coherent cycles of meaning.
